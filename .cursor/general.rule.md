# Project Overview

## Goal
Obsidian Valet is designed to help with learning and referencing the Polish language.

## Languages
- Polish: the target language being learned; note titles, file names, terms, and examples are provided in Polish.
- Ukrainian: the primary language of the vault, used in articles to describe Polish grammar, rules, structures and translations.
- Russian/English: key Polish grammar terms are accompanied by translations in these languages.

## Articles

### Structure
When creating articles, start with simple (basic) concepts and then progress to more complex ones.

### Languages / Translations
- Obsidian/System Title: Polish (without translation)
- Subtitle (at the very beginning of an article): Ukrainian/Russian/English
- Each grammar term: Polish with Ukrainian/Russian/English translations 
- Examples: Polish with Ukrainian/English translations
- Headers: should be translated into Ukrainian and English

### Links
Each internal link is accompanied by Ukrainian/Russian/English translation text (which is not part of the link).
